            <p>
                Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. Founded in 1999, Salesforce empowers companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and artificial intelligence (“AI”), to grow their business and work more productively.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Salesforce Customer Success Platform delivers services spanning sales, service, marketing, commerce, engagement, integration, analytics, industries, communities, enablement and collaboration, most of which operate on a single trusted cloud platform. Our service offerings are designed to be intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed quickly via mobile devices and major internet browsers, configured easily, and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also enable third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications, or apps, that run on our platform, which are sold separately from—or in conjunction with—our service offerings.
            </p>
            <p>          
                Salesforce operates based on a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation and equality. Foremost among these is trust, which is the foundation for everything we do. Our customers trust our technology to deliver the highest levels of security, reliability and availability at scale. We believe our continuous innovation and the democratization of both technology and innovation drives customer success, which in turn drives mutual growth. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives that foster a culture of equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights for our more than 35,000 employees as a leading example for the broader world.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, our customers, our employees, the environment and the communities in which we work and live. Salesforce is committed to transparent environmental, social and governance disclosures and maintaining programs that support the success of these initiatives. Refer to our “Environmental, Social and Governance” discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
            </p>
            <p>
