            <h2 class="underline">Our Growth Strategy</h2>
            <p>We invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:
</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info container">
            <p>
                <strong>Cross selling and upselling.</strong> We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customer experience with premium editions and additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units, with the goal of ultimately becoming our customers’ trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise- wide digital transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct discussions with the highest levels of our customers’ executive management.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Extending existing service offerings.</strong> We offer multiple editions of our cloud service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to expand all editions of our service offerings with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. We have invested heavily in the AI capabilities of Einstein, which allows users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences, as well as innovations like Lightning and Trailhead that improve the entire platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reducing customer attrition.</strong> We strive to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms with us through, among other things, customer success and other related programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Expanding and strengthening the partner ecosystem.</strong> We continue to work with and invest in strategic system integrators (“SIs”) and independent software vendors (“ISVs”) to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries, offer a variety of solutions natively and through the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, and address the business requirements of both current and future customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>International expansion.</strong> We continue to increase our investment in our international go-to-market resources, operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest quality service to our customers around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Targeting vertical industries.</strong> To meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare and government.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Expanding into new horizontal markets.</strong> As part of our growth strategy, which is driven both organically and through acquisitions, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, commerce, IoT and integration, and expect to continue this type of horizontal expansion in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Extending go-to-market capabilities.</strong> We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Promoting strong customer adoption.</strong> We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. We have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies of every size learn our systems, as well as advisory services, technical architects and business strategists to enable and accelerate digital transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform.</strong> The Lightning Platform enables customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will help address the business requirements of both current and future customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the key elements of our growth strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. These evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in fiscal 2019, including MuleSoft, Inc. (“MuleSoft”) and Datorama, Inc. (“Datorama”) which expanded our integration and marketing capabilities.
